- Make sure before the commit, that just the changes of one logical unit are in the staging area.
- Make sure, that all necessary changes are in the staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- Branches help by separating new functions form existing working ones
- Multiple features can be developed without destroying the working copy
- I can always keep a working copy on the master

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- You can easily see the reachability of commits
- You can see lost commits
- You know if you need to merge or to update
